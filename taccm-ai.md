### Action Figure Prompt
Create a Funco pop figurine of the person in this photo. The action figure should be full-figure and displayed in its original blister pack packaging. On top of the box is the name of the toy 'DX Advocate' across a single line of text. In the blister pack packaging, next to the figure, show the toy's accessories, including a laptop, a WCAG guideline booklet, a UX Design book, an AP Stylebook, and a coffee mug labeled 'Alt Text Matters'. Include a large “DX” logo on the figurines shirt. There should be a label on the corner of the box that says 'Inclusive Design Edition’. 
This figure should look like a premium collector's item and everything should be inside the plastic!
