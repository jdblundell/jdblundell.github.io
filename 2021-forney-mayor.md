to tell you a little bit about myself
I’ve been married to john penn for
a long time we have five kids and
several grandkids
i'll always know how long I’ve lived in
Forney because I moved here

on the city council when I lost my son
I realized that we're on this earth for
two reasons I saw life in a whole
different set of glasses and that we're
here to glorify the lord and all we do
and to be of service to others and I
thought what am I going to do
I love Forney I’m going to get on the
city council
little did I know at the time what I was
getting involved in all I wanted to do
was serve my community
and I’ve had to learn to be a politician
to be a public servant so to speak
but as I grew in the position I grew
into a leadership position
and this is where I landed as far as
what's going on with me now I like to
play softball
I’m connected with the community with my
grandkids
and the different things that are going
on I’m an artist
and I like to hang out with
everybody I’m friends with everybody I
listen
to the people and what they have to say

### Question 1
**What actions or inactions led to your decision to run for the position of mayor?**
#### Mary Penn
why I wanted to become mayor and why I wanted
to continue being mayor
I wanted to become mayor because at the
time I felt like
the mayor was not doing
a good job that he wasn't being
effective and I felt as though I could
be a better leader
and the reason that I wanted to continue
being mayor
is because I feel as though I have the
experience and the qualifications
to continue moving the city forward in a
positive manner
since I’ve been mayor we have had
challenges
that no other mayors have ever had to
see
such as the pandemic the george floyd
protest the snovid and
police chief being fired and I think
there's a lot of requirements
of swift action of things that need to
be done
and I feel like I’m the person that can
get those done and that I’ve done a good
job on the thing so far

#### Sandi Primos
the actions that led me to
in government that led me to run for
mayor are very
simple there's so much that's going on
within our government
that have me thinking like
wow what can I do why me
why now right now
the things that are going on within our
local community
have really stunned me and I don't
know what the answer is I don't know how
to answer it but I know that
at right now because I have the time as
a retiree
to look into what's going on within
our future within 40 it gives me the
opportunity
to make a difference I’m not talking
about making history
I’m talking about making a difference in
our local community

#### Andrea Cannon
currently I am not happy with the way
I’m seeing some of the growth
and the ability for Forney to keep money
in our community
we seem to have a lot of businesses
coming in that will encourage money to
leave our community	

#### Amanda Lewis
as I mentioned earlier I’ve been on the
edc board for the last four years
so I have had a lot of interaction with
city employees
and I visited with many of them former
city employees and current city
employees
the morale at city hall is
deplorable in my opinion um it's just
it's sad
and instead of being a keyboard warrior
and complaining through facebook
I decided to step in and make a
difference I want to be on city council
because I think there needs to be a
direction in the leadership that's
lacking
I also think that the citizens are not
being represented properly I think
there's some special interests that are
taking a hold of some of the decisions
that need to be objective
decisions therefore I decided to run for
mayor so I can help lead in a proper way
with my business background 

### Question 2
**What personal or professional experiences or skill sets do you have that makes you the best candidate for Forney's mayor?**

#### Mary Penn
right now the personal or professional
skill sets
that I have that I think would make me
the best mayor is number one I have the
experience
number two I know the political
background that I’m dealing with
and although that shouldn't be something
that
should be a requirement as far as the
city of Forney goes
it is and that's what we have to deal
with and because of that
I feel like that's what one of the
things that makes me the best candidate
another thing that I think makes me a
great candidate for this position
is that I have had transparency I’m open
with the community
I have an open door policy and even with
as much that's been going on recently in
the city
if anything has slipped through the
cracks it has been very few things
because I have been
fielding and responding to
everybody that has been opening up about
everything that's
going on there are a lot of people that
are angry
that are in shock that are hurting about
the situations that have been happening
and I feel as though I’ve been fielding
them and
giving them hope for a positive future

#### Sandi Primos
well personally
I have two master's degrees one's in
counseling
and one's in social work so there you go
I know people I’ve been with people I’ve
worked in family advocacy
drug and alcohol I’ve worked with active
duty soldiers with family members
with people who have drug ism alcoholism
ptsd
anything in the mental health field I’ve
worked with every
type of person from every field in
every situation that you can think of
that's why professionally
I’m a soldier I bleed red white and blue
every day without a doubt
I am here as a professional
I don't take sides I don't do anything
unless it's for the betterment of the
people
that's what I learned in the military
selfless service
selfless service I’m sorry personal
courage
those are my professional skill sets
that I can offer for me
and my values are
family faith
and fun faith is number one
family second fun is third in that order

#### Andrea Cannon
I tend to be a very creative thinker and
problem solver
and I think that's a couple of
characteristics that I’ve seen missing
in our current um government

#### Amanda Lewis
I have both personal and professional
skill sets let me talk first about the
professional
as I mentioned I have a business
background
I do not have a political background I
have a corporate structure mentality
in the way that businesses run there
needs to be efficiencies and funding
I think having a professional background
in corporate business
is probably one of the biggest assets I
do not have a political background
I have a finance background I know
numbers I know how to work numbers
I also know how to manage staff I had a
staff at parkland
that respected me and I was there for
quite a while
different backgrounds different
ethnicities
it takes a group to really move the ship
forward and it takes the respect of your
staff
in order to get your actions implemented
personally I have done a lot of
community service
I am in touch with the people of Forney
we're talking about the seniors that
sometimes are not heard we're talking
about
youth that seems to be overlooked I
think that there's a balance between
having a professional and a personal
skill set
to really understand the needs of the
citizens and then to
represent them properly 

### Question 3
**What specific plans or strategies do you have to bridge the divide between the city and stakeholders such as police fire economic development and Forney ISD**
#### Mary Penn
okay the specific plans
that I have for uniting
the city and the police and fire
department
and the edc and the school district
together first of all
is communication we are lacking in that
with our city manager
and I have been very bold about stating
that his skills in this department are
not
what they need to be I have supported
our police and fire department I have
had conversations with our edc
and with the school district and there's
definitely an issue there the issue is
communication
and my solution to the whole problem is
getting rid of the city manager
because as I go forward I continue to
have the communication that there needs
to be
but as city manager we need an edc
director
our edc director is gone
and the city manager has stepped into
that position he's not qualified to do
that
and as far as I’m concerned he's not
qualified to be over our police and fire
department
they've been in chaos and they need
the strong leader that they had so
my position is to get rid of the city
manager
other than that communication is the
next best thing that we have we all need
to be communicating with each other
 
#### Sandi Primos
I’m just going to state the facts
I’ve heard that there are some issues or
concerns
I don't know for sure but what I can
tell you is that
you go back to the old school way you
talk you use compassion you get everybody
together you listen you learn there's no way
a good leader can come into a new entity
and just start making changes it doesn't work
that way as a leader you have to get those units
together and you have to talk you have to learn
you have to get the families together
that's the only way to bridge a gap
in any entity it doesn't matter if it's
the military doesn't matter if it's a fire department
fire department it doesn't matter
we're all people and we all operate the
same at the end of the day 

#### Andrea Cannon
the first thing that needs to be done is we need to get
a good idea of what the people in Forney
want we have so many new people coming
into Forney and I think unfortunately our current
government is still working on the small
town mentality
whereas we need to be looking at a
bigger picture and the only way to do
that
is to talk to our stakeholders 

#### Amanda Lewis
wow this is a loaded question
I might take up my whole time on this
my plans for let's start with the first
responders
my plans for fire and police
first of all there needs to be funding
that is missing this will require a
forensic audit
which I expect to hopefully implement
once in office
we need to review our financials we need
to see where the funding is going
we need to understand where the district
that is contributing money
for the services that we have where that
money is going
is it going to the fire is it going to
the police there needs to be money into
the training
there also needs to be funding into
um
there needs to be funny funding into the
training there also needs
to be funding into the market structure
of both of these first responder groups
um there needs to be a culture shift and
that means doing a top-down management
review
from city hall all the way down to
those that are doing the job properly
I think a top-down management review of
the people in the proper positions to
see if they have the credentials for
doing the jobs in which they were hired
to do

### Question 4
**If elected what could voters expect from you in the next year?**

#### Mary Penn
if I’m elected what voters can expect
out of me from the next year is number
one I
am going to be getting rid of the city
manager it's not been an easy thing to
do so far but I’m confident that we'll
be able to do that
and get our city needs to heal as far as
that goes
but secondly what I have in place is we
have
just appointed a bond committee and this
is going to be big and this is going to
be exciting for Forney
Forney has not passed a bond in 14 years
and I don't want to wait another 10
years in some areas we're already behind
the curve
we need to get ahead of the curve on
things that we could do
we're in a unique situation with our
roads and highways because of
state highways and county roads but what
can we do in this bond election
we'll be hiring consultants to see if we
can put
spine roads in to relieve traffic
we need to go to the next level with our
parks we have so many kids
that are playing in sports we've got
adult sports now
there's so much talk and buzz about a
library and a community center
our city buildings and they're
bursting at the seams so we have lots of
areas
and I think I have a lot of confidence I
think we put together a great bond
committee that's going to move us
forward
so I’m really looking forward to that
and that's exciting for Forney

#### Sandi Primos
you will see me i'll be visible i'll be
visible to the city of Forney again
I keep saying it I don't
have an occupation other than helping
the constituents of Forney
that's what I’m here for that's why
the city of forty can use me
can love me the way I love you I
will be here for you I don't know
any other way to say it and what you can
expect from me is time honor
service integrity that's what you're
going to get for me
healing I don't know how to say it
but presence is what's really important
right now
you need to see me and i'll be there

#### Andrea Cannon
they can expect me to listen and to work
towards
solving some of our
more prominent and urgent needs

#### Amanda Lewis
the voters can approach me
I represent them the the structure is
citizens
city council and city the represent
representation of the citizens is our
job you have to listen to them you have to
be able to talk to them openly and
honestly I want I will be that person um I am a
leader that can't do her job without knowing all the
facts running on this campaign now I’ve been
meeting with people I’ve been meeting
with former employees
directors fire and police and trying to
figure out the facts and where we are
it takes listening most of this is
listening um people can expect me to follow
through if I say I’m going to do
something that I can
hold personal accountability for I will
do it people can also expect that I will
have a professional attitude
there will be a proper decorum during
city council meetings
things will be led efficiently we're not
going to have this floundering around
during city council meetings
there is always an opportunity for
discussion but there is a
professionalism that I think is lacking
right now
and online people are watching us people
are watching the city of Forney
so it's important to have the type of
environment that people want to do
business with Forney and that's what you
can expect from me

### Question 5
**What are your biggest concerns for Forney's future what solutions do you offer?**

#### Mary Penn
my biggest concerns for
Forney's future
right now are police and fire the safety
of our citizens and along with that
our warning system I’m continuing to
work on trying to get that resolved
we our citizens need to feel safe and
secure and
as it stands right now with everything
going on
with the police chief our police
department and our fire department
I think that people are scared I want to
reassure them
that we are in this together we're going
to work on this
and we're going to fix this situation my

#### Sandi Primos
biggest concerns for forage future
are that there's a big divide
I see that it's clear
what I offer is a new set of eyes
a new set of ears a new opportunity
a new way of thinking
listen I know that some things
are are better said and left along the
way they are
but some things just aren't we gotta get
together
and we got to move forward so what I’m
saying to you
is some of the solutions I can offer you
is
let's have some town hall meetings I
want to hear what you have to say
I want to hear what the constituents
of Forney I want to be
a voice for one city
in other words a city of one voice I
want to speak
on one accord togetherness
let's stand as a united front no more
division
it's not necessary it's been going on
for way
too long that's my solution

#### Andrea Cannon
I believe I mentioned this before my
biggest concern is that some of the
businesses that we are bringing
in are bringing in businesses where the
money will leave
Forney it will not stay here and help
build our economics
and so I would like to see more small
businesses and more local businesses
and encourage better growth that way

#### Amanda Lewis
the biggest concern right now is the
lack of transparency in my opinion
from city management and the council I
do not think that the citizens are
are kept in the know that being said
things can be done without their
knowledge
or be notified after an event
or a decision has been made I’m
concerned about future
development in Forney I think that the
city should be dictating the developers
instead of the other way around
biggest a big concern is the broken
relationships
previously I mentioned fire and police
but what I have failed to mention is the
school district
people come to Forney or any home for
two things they come for safety and they
come for schools
and the one thing we can do on the
safety side of things is put the funding
and the culture in place
and for the schools we can rebuild the
relationships that we have lost
we have broken relationships with the
school district
other elected officials txdot
there's a lot of things that haven't
been progressing as fast as they could
because we haven't had the right elected
officials
meeting face-to-face with the people
that can really make a difference
and the people that have the purse
strings we need to be able to
talk to the right people and represent
everybody instead of just leaving it up
to one or two people
we represent all of Forney citizens and
therefore I think that's one of the
biggest concerns at this point that
they're not being represented properly

### Question 6
**What other issues define your campaign?** 

#### Mary Penn
The issues that define my campaign is I’m
going to keep doing what I’ve always
done I’ve walked and knocked on doors I’ve
talked to people
I’m friendly I take my notepad with me I
Take notes and I’m genuinely concerned with
what the citizens want
I’m here for you I serve you and we're
all in this together
and thank you for your time 

#### Sandi Primos
I’m thinking things like bullying within schools
hostile work environments economic
status meaning this to stimulate the economy
there are several businesses that are
coming to our city there shouldn't be not
one person in Forney
that's unemployed when a new business
comes you got to cut a deal with us how about
you hire our people first
point blank period that's the deal
can a mayor do that sure we can
that's the deal you come here you want
to start a new business
40 constituents get first dibs
how about this bullying thing that's
going on we need education
we need more education on mental health
period there are lots of things going on
in foreign that I know I don't know
about
again I plan to assert myself
all day every day because I have time

#### Andrea Cannon
infrastructure in general in Forney has
not matched growth
we have lots of new housing developments
and being planned
without the infrastructure in place to
deal with the people
coming and going 

#### Amanda Lewis
I’ve already touched on
first responders I’ve touched on the
school district
and even roads one thing that needs to
be touched on
is the amenities in the city of Forney
we have a really good start for a
community park I love it my son goes
there I’ve been there multiple times when he
was when he was young
um I think we can grow that um
unfortunately I think we also need to be
able to maintain those fields
and the recreational amenities which
takes a concerted effort
effort with the city that includes the
parks board I think the parks board does
not have representation now on some of
the future
decisions of how we utilize those
facilities and
charge youth associations
for the use of those fields there's also
a need on the north side
we have 55 acres on the north side
that's been allotted for development
we don't have the funding for it at this
point there are certain things that we
need to consider
in the city's general fund budget we
need to look at what type of ongoing
operations
it will cost to run another park
I do think that we need to continue
drawing in families
through the schools and the safety but
also we need to have the amenities in
place
for recreational use it's going to take
a lot of work with a lot of different
people but I think if we get a strategic
plan in place
I think if we go ahead and revisit the
comprehensive plan
we look at the thoroughfare plan that
was adopted in 2019
to make sure that we have an appropriate
vision and something on paper that we
can adhere to
