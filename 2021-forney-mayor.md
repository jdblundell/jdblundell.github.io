### Video Intro
Hi. I’m Samuel Hahn with Spotlight Forney.
Welcome to a first of its kind video form for candidates for Forney mayor
and city council. The candidates are on
the ballot in the election to be held on
May 1st 2021. 
In the next 40 minutes you will hear the candidates, after they introduce themselves, each

questions beforehand and their staff and supporters were not allowed in the taping.
All candidates on the ballot for mayor and city council were invited to

video are those who declined our invitation.
And now here are the candidates for Forney mayor and city council in their own words.

### Introductions
#### Mary Penn

Hello everybody my name is Mary Penn. I
am the current mayor of Forney. To tell you a little bit about myself,
I’ve been married to John Penn for a long time we have five kids and several grandkids.
I'll always know how long I’ve lived in Forney because I moved here and my daughter Lindsay was born five
days later. And she turned 38 years old in December. So I didn't grow up here but my kids and my grandkids did.
I love this community and I’ve lived here for a long time.
I am a financial planner I’ve worked with school districts for many years. And I’m also an artist.
I started this journey on the city council when I lost my son.
I realized that we're on this earth for two reasons. 
I saw life in a whole different set of glasses and that we're here to glorify the Lord and all we do
and to be of service to others. And I thought, "What am I going to do?"
I love Forney I’m going to get on the city council.
Little did I know at the time what I was getting involved in. All I wanted to do
was serve my community.
And I’ve had to learn to be a politician, to be a public servant so to speak.
But as I grew in the position I grew into a leadership position and this is where I landed.
As far as what's going on with me now, I like to play softball.
I’m connected with the community with my grandkids and the different things that are going
on. I’m an artist
and I like to hang out with
everybody. I’m friends with everybody. I
listen
to the people and what they have to say.

#### Sandi Primos

hi my name is Sandi, with an I, Primos.
The I's for inspiration.
And I am new to Forney but it's okay
because Forney has been place I’ve been
looking at for
the last three years. 
But unfortunately I
wasn't able to move here
as soon as I wanted to because a little
tragedy hit my family.
But now that I’m here I love this place.
I am a single parent of three adult
children. 
One who is an educator here in Forney
and his wife, my daughter in love,
is an educator at Mesquite ISD.
And I have another son who is currently
in graduate school
in University of North Texas, who is
pursuing a
doctorate degree for clinical
neuropsychology.
And I have a daughter who still lives in
Killeen where I moved from
and she is working as a correctional
officer at
the prison in Jack Eduard in Gatesfield.
And I have the love of my life
who is my granddaughter and she goes to
Cadence Academy here in Forney.
I’m a 20-year combat veteran.
I have deployed several times including
to Iraq and Haiti and Kosovo
and the list goes on and on. I came in
the army when I was
17 and now I’m here I have two master's degrees.
One's in counseling, one's in social work.
I know people love people and I’m here to
serve the community of Forney.

#### Andrea Cannon
Hi my name is Andrea Cannon. I have lived
here in Forney for 15 years now
and I really have no early idea what
else to say. 
You can talk about yourself, your family.
I am a teacher. I am married with an
amazing stepdaughter, who is nine, um and I have
too many pets.
And I’m a teacher, I teach high school and I’ve been teaching for 13 years.

#### Amanda Lewis
Hi I’m Amanda Lewis I’ve lived
in Forney for about 18 years.
I come from a corporate and business
background I have a degree in finance
and a master's degree in healthcare
administration.
I have worked at Parkland and the Dallas
County Budget Office.
I was there for over 10 years and I
actually ran a multi-million dollar budget and
staff under the hospital district tax
rate. So there were limitations but I ran a
staff that was very efficient
and we reorganized over the years to
meet the needs of all of the
constituents in Dallas County Hospital
District. I moved to Forney in 2012
and I have been here doing non-profit
community service for many years. I’ve
worked at the Genesis Center
in Kaufman County for it's a battered
women's shelter.
I worked for Appointed Community
Ministries which is a give back program
that works with the school district.
And I’m part of Sharing the Love
Foundation which is a non-profit for um
for youth. I also am on the EDC board. I’m
the secretary on the EDC board for
the City of Forney for the last four
years. 

### Question 1
**What actions or inactions led to your decision to run for the position of mayor?**
#### Mary Penn
Why I wanted to become mayor and why I wanted to continue being mayor.
I wanted to become mayor because at the time I felt like the mayor was not doing a good job, that he wasn't being effective and I felt as though I could
be a better leader.
And the reason that I wanted to continue being mayor is because I feel as though I have the experience and the qualifications
to continue moving the city forward in a positive manner.
Since I’ve been mayor we have had challenges that no other mayors have ever had to see, such as the pandemic, the George Floyd
protest the COVID and police chief being fired. And I think
there's a lot of requirements of swift action of things that need to be done and I feel like I’m the person that can
get those done and that I’ve done a good job on the thing so far.

#### Sandi Primos
The actions that led me to in government, that led me to run for mayor are very simple.
There's so much that's going on within our government that have me thinking, like
wow what can I do? Why me? Why now right now?
The things that are going on within our local community have really stunned me and I don't know what the answer is I don't know how
to answer it but I know that at right now, because I have the time as a retiree, to look into what's going on within our future within Forney, it gives me the
opportunity to make a difference.
I’m not talking about making history, I’m talking about making a difference in our local community.

#### Andrea Cannon
Currently I am not happy with the way I’m seeing some of the growth
and the ability for Forney to keep money in our community.
We seem to have a lot of businesses coming in that will encourage money to leave our community.

#### Amanda Lewis
As I mentioned earlier, I’ve been on the EDC board for the last four years, so I have had a lot of interaction with
city employees.
And I visited with many of them former city employees and current city
employees.
The morale at city hall is
deplorable in my opinion um it's just
it's sad.
And instead of being a keyboard warrior
and complaining through Facebook
I decided to step in and make a
difference. I want to be on city council
because I think there needs to be a
direction in the leadership that's
lacking.
I also think that the citizens are not
being represented properly. I think
there's some special interests that are
taking a hold of some of the decisions
that need to be objective
decisions, therefore I decided to run for
mayor so I can help lead in a proper way with my business background 

### Question 2
**What personal or professional experiences or skill sets do you have that makes you the best candidate for Forney's mayor?**

#### Mary Penn
Right now the personal or professional
skill sets
that I have, that I think would make me
the best mayor, is number one I have the
experience. Number two, I know the political
background that I’m dealing with
and although that shouldn't be something
that
should be a requirement as far as the
city of Forney goes, 
it is and that's what we have to deal
with. And because of that
I feel like that's what one of the
things that makes me the best candidate.
Another thing that I think makes me a
great candidate for this position
is that I have had transparency. I’m open
with the community I have an open door policy and even with
as much that's been going on recently in the city,
if anything has slipped through the
cracks it has been very few things
because I have been
fielding and responding to
everybody that has been opening up about
everything that's
going on. There are a lot of people that
are angry,
that are in shock, that are hurting about
the situations that have been happening
and I feel as though I’ve been fielding
them and
giving them hope for a positive future.

#### Sandi Primos
Well personally
I have two master's degrees, one's in
counseling
and one's in social work so there you go.
I know people, I’ve been with people, I’ve
worked in family advocacy
drug and alcohol. I’ve worked with active
duty soldiers with family members,
with people who have drugism, alcoholism,
PTSD.
Anything in the mental health field I’ve
worked with. Every
type of person from every field, in
every situation that you can think of.
That's why professionally.
I’m a soldier. I bleed red, white and blue,
every day without a doubt.
I am here as a professional.
I don't take sides. I don't do anything
unless it's for the betterment of the
people.
That's what I learned in the military, 
selfless service, 
selfless service. I’m sorry personal
courage.
Those are my professional skill sets
that I can offer for me.
And my values are
family, faith
and fun. Faith is number one.
Family second. Fun is third. In that order.

#### Andrea Cannon
I tend to be a very creative thinker and
problem solver
and I think that's a couple of
characteristics that I’ve seen missing
in our current um government.

#### Amanda Lewis
I have both personal and professional
skill sets. Let me talk first about the
professional.
As I mentioned I have a business
background.
I do not have a political background. I
have a corporate structure mentality
in the way that businesses run. There
needs to be efficiencies and funding.
I think having a professional background
in corporate business
is probably one of the biggest assets. I
do not have a political background.
I have a finance background. I know
numbers, I know how to work numbers.
I also know how to manage staff. I had a
staff at Parkland
that respected me and I was there for
quite a while, 
different backgrounds, different
ethnicities.
It takes a group to really move the ship
forward and it takes the respect of your
staff in order to get your actions implemented.
Personally I have done a lot of
community service.
I am in touch with the people of Forney.
We're talking about the seniors that
sometimes are not heard. We're talking
about
youth that seems to be overlooked. I
think that there's a balance between
having a professional and a personal
skill set to really understand the needs of the
citizens and then to represent them properly.

### Question 3
**What specific plans or strategies do you have to bridge the divide between the city and stakeholders such as police fire economic development and Forney ISD**
#### Mary Penn
Okay the specific plans
that I have for uniting
the city and the police and fire
department
and the EDC and the school district
together. First of all
is communication we are lacking in that
with our city manager.
And I have been very bold about stating
that his skills in this department are
not what they need to be. 
I have supported
our police and fire department. I have
had conversations with our EDC
and with the school district and there's
definitely an issue there. The issue is
communication and my solution to the whole problem is
getting rid of the city manager,
because as I go forward I continue to
have the communication that there needs
to be.
But as city manager, we need an EDC
director.
Our EDC director is gone
and the city manager has stepped into
that position. He's not qualified to do
that
and as far as I’m concerned he's not
qualified to be over our police and fire
department.
They've been in chaos and they need
the strong leader that they had. So
my position is to get rid of the city
manager.
Other than that, communication is the
next best thing that we have we all need
to be communicating with each other.
 
#### Sandi Primos
I’m just going to state the facts.
I’ve heard that there are some issues or
concerns.
I don't know for sure but what I can
tell you is that
you go back to the old school way. You
talk, you use compassion, you get everybody
together, you listen, you learn. There's no way
a good leader can come into a new entity
and just start making changes. It doesn't work.
That way as a leader you have to get those units
together and you have to talk, you have to learn,
you have to get the families together.
That's the only way to bridge a gap
in any entity. It doesn't matter if it's
the military, doesn't matter if it's a fire department.
Fire department, it doesn't matter.
We're all people and we all operate the
same at the end of the day.

#### Andrea Cannon
The first thing that needs to be done is we need to get
a good idea of what the people in Forney
want. We have so many new people coming
into Forney and I think unfortunately our current
government is still working on the small
town mentality.
Whereas we need to be looking at a
bigger picture and the only way to do
that is to talk to our stakeholders.

#### Amanda Lewis
Wow this is a loaded question.
I might take up my whole time on this.
My plans for - let's start with the first
responders.
My plans for fire and police, 
first of all there needs to be funding
that is missing. This will require a
forensic audit
which I expect to hopefully implement
once in office.
We need to review our financials. We need
to see where the funding is going.
We need to understand where the district
that is contributing money
for the services that we have, where that
money is going.
Is it going to the fire? Is it going to
the police? There needs to be money into
the training.
There also needs to be funding into,
um.
There needs to be funny, funding into the
training. There also needs
to be funding into the market structure
of both of these first responder groups.
Um, there needs to be a culture shift and
that means doing a top-down management
review
from city hall, all the way down to
those that are doing the job properly.
I think a top-down management review of
the people in the proper positions to
see if they have the credentials for
doing the jobs in which they were hired
to do.

### Question 4
**If elected what could voters expect from you in the next year?**

#### Mary Penn
If I’m elected, what voters can expect
out of me from the next year is number
one, I am going to be getting rid of the city
manager. It's not been an easy thing to
do so far but I’m confident that we'll
be able to do that.
And get, our city needs to heal as far as
that goes.
But secondly what I have in place is we
have
just appointed a bond committee and this
is going to be big and this is going to
be exciting for Forney.
Forney has not passed a bond in 14 years
and I don't want to wait another 10
years. In some areas we're already behind
the curve.
We need to get ahead of the curve on
things that we could do.
We're in a unique situation with our
roads and highways because of
state highways and county roads. But what
can we do in this bond election?
We'll be hiring consultants to see if we
can put
spine roads in to relieve traffic.
We need to go to the next level with our
parks. We have so many kids
that are playing in sports. We've got
adult sports now.
There's so much talk and buzz about a
library and a community center, our city buildings and they're
bursting at the seams. So we have lots of
areas
and I think I have a lot of confidence. I
think we put together a great bond
committee that's going to move us
forward,
so I’m really looking forward to that
and that's exciting for Forney.

#### Sandi Primos
You will see me I'll be visible. I'll be
visible to the city of Forney. Again
I keep saying it, I don't
have an occupation other than helping
the constituents of Forney.
That's what I’m here for. That's why
the city of Forney can use me,
can love me the way I love you. I
will be here for you. I don't know
any other way to say it. And what you can
expect from me is time, honor,
service, integrity. That's what you're
going to get for me.
Healing, I don't know how to say it
but presence is what's really important
right now.
You need to see me and i'll be there.

#### Andrea Cannon
They can expect me to listen and to work
towards
solving some of our
more prominent and urgent needs.

#### Amanda Lewis
The voters can approach me.
I represent them. The, the structure is
citizens, city council and city. The represent,
representation of the citizens is our
job. You have to listen to them, you have to
be able to talk to them openly and
honestly. I want, I will be that person um, I am a
leader that can't do her job without knowing all the
facts. Running on this campaign now I’ve been
meeting with people. I’ve been meeting
with former employees,
directors, fire and police and trying to
figure out the facts and where we are.
It takes listening. Most of this is
listening. Um, people can expect me to follow
through if I say I’m going to do
something that I can
hold personal accountability for, I will
do it. Pople can also expect that I will
have a professional attitude.
There will be a proper decorum during
city council meetings.
Things will be led efficiently. We're not
going to have this floundering around
during city council meetings.
There is always an opportunity for
discussion but there is a professionalism that I think is lacking
right now.
And online, people are watching us. People
are watching the city of Forney
so it's important to have the type of
environment that people want to do
business with Forney. And that's what you
can expect from me.

### Question 5
**What are your biggest concerns for Forney's future what solutions do you offer?**

#### Mary Penn
My biggest concerns for
Forney's future
right now are police and fire the safety
of our citizens. And along with that,
our warning system. I’m continuing to
work on trying to get that resolved.
We our citizens need to feel safe and
secure and
as it stands right now, with everything
going on
with the police chief, our police
department and our fire department,
I think that people are scared. I want to
reassure them
that we are in this together, we're going
to work on this
and we're going to fix this situation.

#### Sandi Primos
My biggest concerns for Forney's future
are that there's a big divide.
I see that it's clear.
What I offer is a new set of eyes,
a new set of ears, a new opportunity,
a new way of thinking.
Listen, I know that some things
are are better said and left along the
way they are,
but some things just aren't. We gotta get
together
and we got to move forward. So what I’m
saying to you
is some of the solutions I can offer you
is
let's have some town hall meetings. I
want to hear what you have to say.
I want to hear what the constituents
of Forney. I want to be
a voice for one city.
In other words, a city of one voice. I
want to speak
on one accord, togetherness.
Let's stand as a united front. No more
division.
It's not necessary. It's been going on
for way
too long. That's my solution.

#### Andrea Cannon
I believe I mentioned this before. My
biggest concern is that some of the
businesses that we are bringing
in are bringing in businesses where the
money will leave
Forney. Tt will not stay here and help
build our economics.
And so I would like to see more small
businesses and more local businesses
and encourage better growth that way.

#### Amanda Lewis
The biggest concern right now is the
lack of transparency. In my opinion
from city management and the council, I
do not think that the citizens are
are kept in the know. That being said,
things can be done without their
knowledge
or be notified after an event
or a decision has been made. I’m
concerned about future
development in Forney. I think that the
city should be dictating the developers
instead of the other way around.
Biggest, a big concern is the broken
relationships.
Previously I mentioned fire and police
but what I have failed to mention is the
school district.
People come to Forney or any home for
two things. They come for safety and they
come for schools.
And the one thing we can do on the
safety side of things is put the funding
and the culture in place.
And for the schools, we can rebuild the
relationships that we have lost.
We have broken relationships with the
school district,
other elected officials, TxDOT.
There's a lot of things that haven't
been progressing as fast as they could
because we haven't had the right elected
officials meeting face-to-face with the people
that can really make a difference
and the people that have the purse
strings. We need to be able to
talk to the right people and represent
everybody instead of just leaving it up
to one or two people.
We represent all of Forney citizens and
therefore I think that's one of the
biggest concerns at this point that
they're not being represented properly.

### Question 6
**What other issues define your campaign?** 

#### Mary Penn
The issues that define my campaign is I’m
going to keep doing what I’ve always
done. I’ve walked and knocked on doors. I’ve
talked to people.
I’m friendly. I take my notepad with me. I
take notes and I’m genuinely concerned with
what the citizens want.
I’m here for you. I serve you and we're
all in this together
and thank you for your time. 

#### Sandi Primos
I’m thinking things like bullying within schools,
hostile work environments, economic
status, meansing this to stimulate the economy.
There are several businesses that are
coming to our city. There shouldn't be not
one person in Forney
that's unemployed when a new business
comes. You got to cut a deal with us. How about
you hire our people first,
point blank, period, that's the deal.
Can a mayor do that? Sure we can.
That's the deal. You come here, you want
to start a new business, Forney
constituents get first dibs.
How about this bullying thing that's
going on? We need education.
We need more education on mental health,
period. There are lots of things going on
in Forney that I know I don't know
about.
Again I plan to assert myself
all day every day because I have time.

#### Andrea Cannon
Infrastructure in general in Forney has
not matched growth.
We have lots of new housing developments
and being planned,
without the infrastructure in place to
deal with the people
coming and going.

#### Amanda Lewis
I’ve already touched on first responders. I’ve touched on the
school district
and even roads. One thing that needs to
be touched on is the amenities in the city of Forney.
We have a really good start for a
community park. I love it. My son goes
there. I’ve been there multiple times when he
was when he was young.
Um I think we can grow that. Um
unfortunately I think we also need to be
able to maintain those fields
and the recreational amenities, which
takes a concerted effort,
effort with the city. That includes the
parks board. I think the parks board does
not have representation now on some of
the future
decisions of how we utilize those
facilities and
charge youth associations
for the use of those fields. There's also
a need on the north side
we have 55 acres on the north side
that's been allotted for development.
We don't have the funding for it at this
point. There are certain things that we
need to consider
in the city's general fund budget. We
need to look at what type of ongoing
operations
it will cost to run another park.
I do think that we need to continue
drawing in families
through the schools and the safety but
also we need to have the amenities in
place
for recreational use. It's going to take
a lot of work with a lot of different
people but I think if we get a strategic
plan in place,
I think if we go ahead and revisit the
comprehensive plan,
we look at the thoroughfare plan that
was adopted in 2019,
to make sure that we have an appropriate
vision and something on paper that we
can adhere to.
