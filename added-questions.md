---

I've asked the following questions on the Facebook pages of the candidates I could locate. I'll add their responses here as I collect them. Candidates can [message me their responses](https://www.facebook.com/jdblundell) as well.

1. What is the role of the mayor and city council?
2. What is the role of the city government?
3. With the large growth happening in the city limits as well as outside the city limits (including in Dallas and Mesquite ETJs as well as Kaufman County), what are your thoughts on future annexation or land swaps for Forney?
4. What city services and/or amenities are lacking in Forney and how do you plan to address the shortfalls?
5. TxDOT, NCTCOG and Kaufman County have several long term plans for transportation plans involving Forney, including widening Hwy 80 and possibly passenger rail going to Terrell. How will you work with these entities to ensure
transportation infrastructure is maximized to best serve the future growth in and around Forney?

**1. What is the role of the mayor and city council?**

The role of the mayor and council is to set policy, work together, in a healthy manner, listen to our citizens and do what is best for the city as a whole. 
The mayor leads the city council meeting and signs necessary documents. 

**2. What is the role of the city government?** 

The role of the city government is to provide adequate protection for our citizens, through our fire and police departments, take care of our infrastructure, with our
public works department, make sure developments are done properly with our planning and zoning department and that our city is run efficiently with our city manager. 
Other things also, but tried to touch on the main things. 

**3. With the large growth happening in the city limits as well as outside the city limits (including in Dallas and Mesquite ETJs as well as Kaufman County), what are your thoughts on future annexation or land swaps for Forney?**

The laws have changed on annexation, and you cannot do involuntary annexation anymore. Most landowners do not want to be annexed. Some commercial and industrial 
developers want to be annexed, for city services, and it is a win/win situation, when this happens, for the tax benefits to the city. I would not have a problem 
with a land swap, but we really don't have anything to offer, to make that happen. Example, Devonshire is in Dallas ETJ. Would love to have them a part of Forney,
but we have nothing to give Dallas in return. We could not annex them anyway, because of the law change. 

**4. What city services and/or amenities are lacking in Forney and how do you plan to address the shortfalls?**

In my opinion, the city services that are lacking, we need to keep up with police and fire, as the city continues to grow. This will be covered in the budget process.
Also, we have outgrown our facilities, need a fire station on the south side, a library, community center, senior center, spine roads to help with traffic, addition to our
parks, and all of these things will be covered in our newly formed bond committee, which will be put in front of the voters. 

**5. TxDOT, NCTCOG and Kaufman County have several long term plans for transportation plans involving Forney, including widening Hwy 80 and possibly passenger rail going to Terrell. How will you work with these entities to ensure transportation infrastructure is maximized to best serve the future growth in and around Forney?**

We have great representation with our transportation governing bodies. Our city engineer, Karl Zook, who is the expert in this area, meets regularly with them,
working together on our needs. I also speak regularly with Skeet Phillips, our county commission, who is doing a great job, looking out for Forney. I hope I answered
all your questions, to give you a better understanding of what we do and are doing, to make Forney all that it can be!

**1. What is the role of the mayor and city council?**

The role of the Mayor and Council are to act as a governing body for our city. Our job is to appropriately and carefully administer the funds our city has. The first step in doing that is building a comprehensive growth plan for Forney. If we are going to carefully manage the funds we have, we must be operating off a plan. A comprehensive plan needs to be developed to address our housing needs, local roads, city services, first responder groups, and our local small businesses. We are also responsible for protecting our citizens, protecting our city employees, and protecting our city budget. A careful look at the current budget and past spending will be an important start point. What frivolous or wasteful spending has occurred? What departments are in need of more funding? A strategic and comprehensive growth plan needs to be a top priority for our city council and mayor. 

**2. What is the role of the city government?** 

The city government’s main role is to protect our citizens, and their interests. We provide that protection by have adequately staffed, trained and compensated first responder groups. The city government also protects the citizens by carefully using the tax dollars collected, to benefit our city. Prudent and carefully thought out purchases should be a top priority for our government. 

**3. With the large growth happening in the city limits as well as outside the city limits (including in Dallas and Mesquite ETJs as well as Kaufman County), what are your thoughts on future annexation or land swaps for Forney?**

The financial stability of our city must be our first concern. Fully vetting the benefits versus the costs, to our city, would need to happen before we look into annexing additional land. We would need to evaluate the cost and benefit our city.

**4. What city services and/or amenities are lacking in Forney and how do you plan to address the shortfalls?**

Our city’s operating budget and how we are spending it, is crucial to safeguarding our citizens and the integrity of our city services. One reason I decided to run for City Council is that I was concerned with HOW our city budget was being spent. The core services that we offer residents-namely police and fire protection and our local roads, have not been taken care of. That is a huge concern to me. Our city budget, and large parts of it, have gone to what I call the “extras”. These are events and costly activities that are taking up large parts of our city budget. Are these events bad? No, of course not. And we DO want to provide good, quality events in town for our residents. But these events and non essential expenditures are coming BEFORE taking care of core services. We are paying for the “extras” before we are paying for the “essentials”. Supporting our first responders is a huge priority to me. Increasing pay, and increasing the size of both our police and fire department are essential services for our city. They aren’t extras. If we want to support growth in our town, we have to protect our citizens, and that can only happen if we have the appropriate number of both police and fire personnel. A second area I would like to direct fund from our operating budget are to our local, non txdot city roads. If we want to support growth, we have got to ease congestion in the areas of town that we can control. That means building more roads. Other city services and/or amenities we lack are a community center, a senior citizen center, and a standalone library.

How are we going to pay for these items? Some redirection from the general fund will need to occur. Many of the other needs can be addressed in the bond our city is considering. How much the bond would be for, what it would cover, and the affect on taxes are all currently being explored by our bond committee, which was recently formed.

**5. TxDOT, NCTCOG and Kaufman County have several long term plans for transportation plans involving Forney, including widening Hwy 80 and possibly passenger rail going to Terrell. How will you work with these entities to ensure transportation infrastructure is maximized to best serve the future growth in and around Forney?**

As a special education teacher, I learned a lot about being an advocate, and what that is. I had to advocate for my students, to help them get the type and amount of services that they needed. I also taught parents how to advocate for their children. Not just with the school district, but with doctors, private therapists, anyone in their life. No one will advocate for your child the way that you will as a parent. You are the person in their life who is ht MOST invested in their health, happiness, and well being. I have experienced this with my own children. I am their advocate. 

The situation with TXDOT is the same. Forney needs an advocate. Forney needs leaders and council members who will advocate to TXDOT on our behalf. No one is going to speak up for us and represent us, as well as leaders from our own city could. I have heard current city leadership say “the city engineer meets with TXDOT often”. Or, “the city engineer meets with county officials often”. What are missing from those statements are how often the Mayor or City Council members are attending and initiating meetings with TXDOT, and the entities that control the major roads into and out of Forney. Showing up at both the Dallas regional office, and in Austin is going to be key in building a relationship with TXDOT. This is about building relationships. Showing up in their office. Telling them what our town needs. And when you do that, you show back up again. And again. Until something happens. Our city desperately needs advocates with TXDOT.
