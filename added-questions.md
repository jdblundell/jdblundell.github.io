title: 2021 Forney Added Questions
layout: post
---

I've asked the following questions on the Facebook pages of the candidates I could locate. I'll add their responses here as I collect them. Candidates can [message me their responses](https://www.facebook.com/jdblundell) as well.

1. What is the role of the mayor and city council?
2. What is the role of the city government?
3. With the large growth happening in the city limits as well as outside the city limits (including in Dallas and Mesquite ETJs as well as Kaufman County), what are your thoughts on future annexation or land swaps for Forney?
4. What city services and/or amenities are lacking in Forney and how do you plan to address the shortfalls?
5. TxDOT, NCTCOG and Kaufman County have several long term plans for transportation plans involving Forney, including widening Hwy 80 and possibly passenger rail going to Terrell. How will you work with these entities to ensure
transportation infrastructure is maximized to best serve the future growth in and around Forney?

1. The role of the mayor and council is to set policy, work together, in a healthy manner, listen to our citizens and do what is best for the city as a whole. 
The mayor leads the city council meeting and signs necessary documents. 
2. The role of the city government is to provide adequate protection for our citizens, through our fire and police departments, take care of our infrastructure, with our
public works department, make sure developments are done properly with our planning and zoning department and that our city is run efficiently with our city manager. 
Other things also, but tried to touch on the main things. 
3. The laws have changed on annexation, and you cannot do involuntary annexation anymore. Most landowners do not want to be annexed. Some commercial and industrial 
developers want to be annexed, for city services, and it is a win/win situation, when this happens, for the tax benefits to the city. I would not have a problem 
with a land swap, but we really don't have anything to offer, to make that happen. Example, Devonshire is in Dallas ETJ. Would love to have them a part of Forney,
but we have nothing to give Dallas in return. We could not annex them anyway, because of the law change. 
4. In my opinion, the city services that are lacking, we need to keep up with police and fire, as the city continues to grow. This will be covered in the budget process.
Also, we have outgrown our facilities, need a fire station on the south side, a library, community center, senior center, spine roads to help with traffic, addition to our
parks, and all of these things will be covered in our newly formed bond committee, which will be put in front of the voters. 
5. We have great representation with our transportation governing bodies. Our city engineer, Karl Zook, who is the expert in this area, meets regularly with them,
working together on our needs. I also speak regularly with Skeet Phillips, our county commission, who is doing a great job, looking out for Forney. I hope I answered
all your questions, to give you a better understanding of what we do and are doing, to make Forney all that it can be!
