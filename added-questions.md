---

I've asked the following questions on the Facebook pages of the candidates I could locate. I'll add their responses here as I collect them. Candidates can [message me their responses](https://www.facebook.com/jdblundell) as well.

1. What is the role of the mayor and city council?
2. What is the role of the city government?
3. With the large growth happening in the city limits as well as outside the city limits (including in Dallas and Mesquite ETJs as well as Kaufman County), what are your thoughts on future annexation or land swaps for Forney?
4. What city services and/or amenities are lacking in Forney and how do you plan to address the shortfalls?
5. TxDOT, NCTCOG and Kaufman County have several long term plans for transportation plans involving Forney, including widening Hwy 80 and possibly passenger rail going to Terrell. How will you work with these entities to ensure
transportation infrastructure is maximized to best serve the future growth in and around Forney?

**1. What is the role of the mayor and city council?**

The role of the mayor and council is to set policy, work together, in a healthy manner, listen to our citizens and do what is best for the city as a whole. 
The mayor leads the city council meeting and signs necessary documents. 

**2. What is the role of the city government?** 

The role of the city government is to provide adequate protection for our citizens, through our fire and police departments, take care of our infrastructure, with our
public works department, make sure developments are done properly with our planning and zoning department and that our city is run efficiently with our city manager. 
Other things also, but tried to touch on the main things. 

**3. With the large growth happening in the city limits as well as outside the city limits (including in Dallas and Mesquite ETJs as well as Kaufman County), what are your thoughts on future annexation or land swaps for Forney?**

The laws have changed on annexation, and you cannot do involuntary annexation anymore. Most landowners do not want to be annexed. Some commercial and industrial 
developers want to be annexed, for city services, and it is a win/win situation, when this happens, for the tax benefits to the city. I would not have a problem 
with a land swap, but we really don't have anything to offer, to make that happen. Example, Devonshire is in Dallas ETJ. Would love to have them a part of Forney,
but we have nothing to give Dallas in return. We could not annex them anyway, because of the law change. 

**4. What city services and/or amenities are lacking in Forney and how do you plan to address the shortfalls?**

In my opinion, the city services that are lacking, we need to keep up with police and fire, as the city continues to grow. This will be covered in the budget process.
Also, we have outgrown our facilities, need a fire station on the south side, a library, community center, senior center, spine roads to help with traffic, addition to our
parks, and all of these things will be covered in our newly formed bond committee, which will be put in front of the voters. 

**5. TxDOT, NCTCOG and Kaufman County have several long term plans for transportation plans involving Forney, including widening Hwy 80 and possibly passenger rail going to Terrell. How will you work with these entities to ensure transportation infrastructure is maximized to best serve the future growth in and around Forney?**

We have great representation with our transportation governing bodies. Our city engineer, Karl Zook, who is the expert in this area, meets regularly with them,
working together on our needs. I also speak regularly with Skeet Phillips, our county commission, who is doing a great job, looking out for Forney. I hope I answered
all your questions, to give you a better understanding of what we do and are doing, to make Forney all that it can be!

## Sarah Salgado

**1. What is the role of the mayor and city council?**

The role of the Mayor and Council are to act as a governing body for our city. Our job is to appropriately and carefully administer the funds our city has. The first step in doing that is building a comprehensive growth plan for Forney. If we are going to carefully manage the funds we have, we must be operating off a plan. A comprehensive plan needs to be developed to address our housing needs, local roads, city services, first responder groups, and our local small businesses. We are also responsible for protecting our citizens, protecting our city employees, and protecting our city budget. A careful look at the current budget and past spending will be an important start point. What frivolous or wasteful spending has occurred? What departments are in need of more funding? A strategic and comprehensive growth plan needs to be a top priority for our city council and mayor. 

**2. What is the role of the city government?** 

The city government’s main role is to protect our citizens, and their interests. We provide that protection by have adequately staffed, trained and compensated first responder groups. The city government also protects the citizens by carefully using the tax dollars collected, to benefit our city. Prudent and carefully thought out purchases should be a top priority for our government. 

**3. With the large growth happening in the city limits as well as outside the city limits (including in Dallas and Mesquite ETJs as well as Kaufman County), what are your thoughts on future annexation or land swaps for Forney?**

The financial stability of our city must be our first concern. Fully vetting the benefits versus the costs, to our city, would need to happen before we look into annexing additional land. We would need to evaluate the cost and benefit our city.

**4. What city services and/or amenities are lacking in Forney and how do you plan to address the shortfalls?**

Our city’s operating budget and how we are spending it, is crucial to safeguarding our citizens and the integrity of our city services. One reason I decided to run for City Council is that I was concerned with HOW our city budget was being spent. The core services that we offer residents-namely police and fire protection and our local roads, have not been taken care of. That is a huge concern to me. Our city budget, and large parts of it, have gone to what I call the “extras”. These are events and costly activities that are taking up large parts of our city budget. Are these events bad? No, of course not. And we DO want to provide good, quality events in town for our residents. But these events and non essential expenditures are coming BEFORE taking care of core services. We are paying for the “extras” before we are paying for the “essentials”. Supporting our first responders is a huge priority to me. Increasing pay, and increasing the size of both our police and fire department are essential services for our city. They aren’t extras. If we want to support growth in our town, we have to protect our citizens, and that can only happen if we have the appropriate number of both police and fire personnel. A second area I would like to direct fund from our operating budget are to our local, non txdot city roads. If we want to support growth, we have got to ease congestion in the areas of town that we can control. That means building more roads. Other city services and/or amenities we lack are a community center, a senior citizen center, and a standalone library.

How are we going to pay for these items? Some redirection from the general fund will need to occur. Many of the other needs can be addressed in the bond our city is considering. How much the bond would be for, what it would cover, and the affect on taxes are all currently being explored by our bond committee, which was recently formed.

**5. TxDOT, NCTCOG and Kaufman County have several long term plans for transportation plans involving Forney, including widening Hwy 80 and possibly passenger rail going to Terrell. How will you work with these entities to ensure transportation infrastructure is maximized to best serve the future growth in and around Forney?**

As a special education teacher, I learned a lot about being an advocate, and what that is. I had to advocate for my students, to help them get the type and amount of services that they needed. I also taught parents how to advocate for their children. Not just with the school district, but with doctors, private therapists, anyone in their life. No one will advocate for your child the way that you will as a parent. You are the person in their life who is ht MOST invested in their health, happiness, and well being. I have experienced this with my own children. I am their advocate. 

The situation with TXDOT is the same. Forney needs an advocate. Forney needs leaders and council members who will advocate to TXDOT on our behalf. No one is going to speak up for us and represent us, as well as leaders from our own city could. I have heard current city leadership say “the city engineer meets with TXDOT often”. Or, “the city engineer meets with county officials often”. What are missing from those statements are how often the Mayor or City Council members are attending and initiating meetings with TXDOT, and the entities that control the major roads into and out of Forney. Showing up at both the Dallas regional office, and in Austin is going to be key in building a relationship with TXDOT. This is about building relationships. Showing up in their office. Telling them what our town needs. And when you do that, you show back up again. And again. Until something happens. Our city desperately needs advocates with TXDOT. 

## Craig Chapman

**1. What is the role of the mayor and city council?**

Our mayor and city council serve the purpose as the elected representatives of the people of Forney. They're the ones who make decisions on how our taxes are spent and how we move forward as a city. It is not their role to act in the interest of a small subset of citizens or to view taxpayers as a blank check much like other growing suburbs. We must remember that the Mayor and council only get their power from "we the people". The expectation is that they will be good stewards of the taxpayer like you and me.

**2. What is the role of the city government?** 

The city's role is to execute the will of the people. The people of Forney want to live in a safe city, one with schools of the first class and businesses that serve the needs of everyone. It is the city government that ensures a properly funded police and fire department while at the same time being able to handle other needs of the city such as road repair and maintenance. 

**3. With the large growth happening in the city limits as well as outside the city limits (including in Dallas and Mesquite ETJs as well as Kaufman County), what are your thoughts on future annexation or land swaps for Forney?**

Two legislative sessions ago, Governor Abbott signed Senate Bill 6 that would put a move like this up to a vote by the people in the proposed area for annexation. While I do think it's inevitable that the city limits will grow with time, the barrier to annexation is much more difficult than what it used to be. The problem will lie in residential areas where citizens may reject a move towards annexation. It's easy to look at an area like Lone Star Estates or Devonshire with a cost/benefit analysis but the law prohibits us from having the final say. 

**4. What city services and/or amenities are lacking in Forney and how do you plan to address the shortfalls?**

Amenities that we are currently lacking include a library, more park space on the north side, and a community center. While I've been on the campaign trail these three are the ones most people bring up to me. We currently have a bond committee formed and they will be discussing these things and much more. It will ultimately come down to the voters who will decide whether or not we should spend money on these amenities. For city services it's important for us to make sure our police and fire are keeping up with the demand that we'll be seeing over the next decade. I'm sure you've seen the report released that named Forney the number two suburb to live in for 2021. People around the country are taking note! We need to be prepared and this is something that will have to be addressed during budget season. 

Our top 3 expenditures in the budget for FY 2021 are police, fire, and streets which represents almost half of the budget. One city service that I also think is lacking and will be addressed if I'm elected is the walking condition of our sidewalks. We have a lot of areas in Forney that require driving because walking is too burdensome, one great example is walking home from FHS if you live in Chestnut Meadows, Overland Grove, and Grayhawk. We can't reduce traffic by introducing more vehicles onto the road but at the same time we can't allow residents to walk through creeks or the shoulder of an FM road just to get to school or visit a local business. If we have an opportunity to improve the walkability of our neighborhoods, we need to take a serious look at it.

**5. TxDOT, NCTCOG and Kaufman County have several long term plans for transportation plans involving Forney, including widening Hwy 80 and possibly passenger rail going to Terrell. How will you work with these entities to ensure transportation infrastructure is maximized to best serve the future growth in and around Forney?**

This is an important question because it represents a stark difference between me and my opponent in this election. I've spoken with Mr Zook who is the city engineer for Forney and he meets with TxDOT on a monthly basis. He is our advocate and has done a great job. Highway 80 and 1641 are both set to build out fall 2022, 548 is set to build out spring 2023, and the major work being done on 741 is set for 2025. Those dates are set because of the positive relationship we have with TxDOT. 

My opponent and her team are running on the platform that the answer to our congestion problem is to form a coalition with neighboring cities and that adding lanes is always an easy fix. This is simply wishful thinking not based in reality. Coalitions do not work as far as TxDOT is concerned. They operate based on algorithms powered by traffic studies, growth estimates, and existing demand. There is nothing a coalition can do to sway TxDOT in acting a certain way. The I-45 Coalition in the Houston area has been a 4 year disaster and is why Judge Lina Hidalgo filed a lawsuit against TxDOT. As far as lane expansion goes, it's not as simple as my opponent makes it out to be. Yes we need roads and a certain number of lanes for a city to function. We have to make sure residents can get from point A to point B as well as make sure emergency services can respond appropriately. But if adding lanes to an existing road reduced congestion, why hasn't it happened in other Dallas area suburbs where they've spent millions of dollars while seeing zero relief in traffic? If you want to take this example to an extreme, look at California. They continue to expand the 101 freeway in Los Angeles yet traffic continues to be at historic levels, the opposite of its intended goal. The expansion of major highways is not for the local benefit but for the benefit of the region as a whole to fulfill TxDOT's primary mission and vision to move people & connect Texans. The city has a thoroughfare plan in place which will help with traffic flow as our city continues to grow. We must make sure to not waste millions of tax dollars on false promises.

## Amanda Lewis

**1. What is the role of the mayor and city council?**

The role of the mayor and city council is to administer the budget, propose and adhere to ordinances, manage municipal affairs, give guidance to city management whilst representing the city’s constituents’ best interests to ensure a viable future. The mayor’s role in particular is to lead the group, guide the conversation at Council meetings, and be a knowledgeable resource for its citizens and council members at all times. The Mayor is both this and a representative of the City and its residents to the outside communities.

**2. What is the role of the city government?** 

The role of the city government is to oversee the operations and functions of the City. This includes ensuring the proper level of protection from the Fire and Police departments, coordinating the appropriate infrastructure, providing amenities, and being a partner to other taxing entities. All of this is accomplished under the umbrella of its adopted budget through the proper utilization of its funds.

**3. With the large growth happening in the city limits as well as outside the city limits (including in Dallas and Mesquite ETJs as well as Kaufman County), what are your thoughts on future annexation or land swaps for Forney?**

House Bill 347 adopted two years ago limits the ability to annex without landowner or voter approval.  I can’t imagine those in the ETJ voting as a whole to be incorporated with the City alongside its taxes and this is no longer a viable option for cities in Texas. I think more importantly is how we serve those in the ETJ – particularly in regards to Fire. Over 40% of calls coming in are from outside the City limits. We need the funding and staff to continue to meet the needs of these new residents.

**4. What city services and/or amenities are lacking in Forney and how do you plan to address the shortfalls?**
City Services lacking:
* a.	Police (standard hovers around 2/ 1,000 residents). We are understaffed and not up to market. Current staffing level is at 32.
* b.	Fire as mentioned above has higher demand for services and has received no COLA since 2016. 
* c.	Street department has a high demand for service. We need to address the staffing level, funding, and its priority list.

Amenities lacking:
* i.	Community Park on the north side of 80
* ii.	Community Center/ Senior and Youth Facility
* iii.	Library

**5. TxDOT, NCTCOG and Kaufman County have several long term plans for transportation plans involving Forney, including widening Hwy 80 and possibly passenger rail going to Terrell. How will you work with these entities to ensure transportation infrastructure is maximized to best serve the future growth in and around Forney?**

Forney has 6 projects in the Kaufman County Transportation Bond package and an approved ‘Thoroughfare Plan’, which has seen little traction. City management may meet regularly with the County TxDOT consultant, but elected officials have not. I would propose that Council meet with neighboring cities along the Highway 80 corridor and county-elected officials and form a ‘coalition’. We would be an asset as a whole to have a presence at both regional and state offices. Does TxDOT need something from Forney? What is Forney being asked to contribute? Regardless, what is currently being done is clearly not working, so Forney needs to work with its partners to help in the best ways possible to have a presence and aid in any way to escalate the Highway 80 expansion on its list.
