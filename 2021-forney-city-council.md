place I’m a fifth generation teacher I come

science in special education with an
emphasis in severe disabilities

for 40 city council because I can see
Forney's huge potential
I want to be part of the solution for
managing our explosive growth
we do have some concerns that we need to
address as a city
I want to be part of the solution to
manage those concerns 

#### Craig Chapman
hello Forney my name is Craig Chapman and I am running
for city council in place
four a little bit about myself my
parents moved my sister and I out here
to kaufman county in 1997 and I grew up
in maybank
when I graduated college I brought my
college sweetheart my wife candace back
to the area with me
where she serves as a hospital
pharmacist in dallas as for me
I’m a community pharmacist working in a
family business my family has owned
since the 70s
I’m also a small small business owner I
own a long-term care
company that deals with hospice and
nursing homes
my very first job at a pharmacy school
was right here in Forney
I got I was the intern that got to open
up the pharmacy at kroger
during my time there I got to meet so
many amazing people the people here
they were kind they were caring they
were funny
and they were passionate and that was
about six or seven years ago
city has changed a lot since then but
the people here are still great
it's why I call Forney home and like
many of you
I know there's been a lot of controversy
in the news
about our city manager the chief of
police
it's disturbed me deeply our city is in
desperate need
of leadership city hall needs someone
who can solve problems
someone who's ready to responsibly
manage our growth
fiscal responsibility as well as
supporting our police and fire
i'd be honored to have your support as
well as your vote in our Forney city
council
for place four 

### Question 1
**What qualities or expertise will you bring to the council that will be helpful to Forney?**

#### Jason Roberson
I have a background in marketing and
communications
I’ve been a journalist and as a
journalist your job is to take
complicated information
and simplify it so everybody can
understand it I’ve been a business
journalist
writing about complicated tax policies
different business organizations and so
forth and
my goal is to make sure that I can bring
in as many readers as possible well how
is that helpful
it's helpful because everybody in 40
needs to be informed about the issues
that we're facing it's time that we
straighten out the org chart
you the citizens deserve to be at the
very top you deserve to be able to have
the information we can't make
decisions in a silo anymore we can no
longer
make decisions in an echo chamber the
city council is not in charge
the city manager is not in charge it's
you the people
and I believe that with my skill set on
the council
i'll be able to explain information in a
way that brings everybody in so that we
can all take part
in our democracy 

#### Sarah Salgado
As a classroom teacher
I did more
than just teach I managed a team of
assistant teachers
I also taught special needs students who
by the very name
each have special needs they all had
their individualized education program
this required a lot of coordination I
had to coordinate efforts between a team
of paraprofessionals
a team of specialists I had to work with
parents with administrators
with outside experts I needed to have
the ability to analyze data
and develop solutions that were
individual to each child
as a small business owner I’ve learned
how to manage my own budget
as a member of the Forney city council I
will be able to bring all those
qualities to our leadership here in
Forney 

#### Craig Chapman
I’ve been a pharmacist since 2014. One of the most important qualities of a
pharmacist is being able to solve problems I get calls text messages from
physicians all over DFW looking for help
whether it be an elderly patient who
can't swallow her meds
a young patient who spits out their meds
these are real issues I deal with on a
daily basis and it's something I can
bring
to the citizens of foreign you know we
are tired
when I say we I mean the citizens are
tired of this bickering
this non-stop gridlock that we see in
city government you see it in washington
all the time we see it in austin
that kind of attitude shouldn't be here
in Forney we should be able to work
together
as one for the betterment of our
community and our citizens

### Question 2
**How do you define transparency and how important is it to you and what level of transparency should citizens and stakeholders expect from the city and council?**

#### Jason Roberson
It's interesting. Transparency to me is more than having
access to publicly available documents
it's being able to understand those
documents it's one thing to just present
the documents
and information and say here you are you
have access to it
it's another thing to be able to take
the time and to explain it to where
everybody feels like they're involved in
the conversation
and that's what I believe transparency
is for me I think that every citizen
deserves to be involved in a
conversation
information that's talked about in
closed executive sessions obviously by
law we can't talk about those things
but outside of it I believe that we can
directionally share
everything that's been discussed that's
our role as a city council to make sure
that the real bosses you the people are
in charge

#### Sarah Salgado
Transparency to me simply means having
integrity integrity is choosing what's correct and
what is right for our citizens even if
it means standing alone I will bring a level of
transparency to our citizens by simply
being able to listen
and also by being involved in how our
city hall is managed
how are our city employees treated are
the needs of our citizens
actually being looked after transparency
means having no outside influences
influencing my vote or how I manage my
time on the city council

#### Craig Chapman
Transparency to me sounds like a country
phrase but it means speaking straight
from the horse's mouth
telling the raw unfiltered truth to the
people who need to hear it.
Forney politics shouldn't be foreign
politicians shouldn't be viewed as
mythological creatures that you can't
talk to
you can only run in their circles if you
want their influence if
you if you want to just get their ear
you have to
go through hoops it shouldn't work like
that transparency means
real honesty you know when as a
pharmacist when
my patients come to me with their
medicare plans every fall
I’m the one that has to look them in the
eye and tell them sorry ms jones
your plans are going up by even just a
dollar
and these are patients that that live on
fixed incomes so when their income goes
up
their expenses go up by a dollar they
know it and trust me
they'll tell me and that kind of
transparency is
what i'll bring to the Forney city
council is this raw unfiltered truth

### Question 3
**Are there any developers, companies or organizations, or their representatives, with interest in Forney, that have contributed to your campaign financially, in kind or otherwise, or that have reached out to you or have reached out to you for information and or offer their support? Please explain.**

#### Jason Roberson
In short no now a more full answer is that right now
less than five percent of voters
actually vote less than five percent when that happens
that gives way for uh former elected officials who can kind of
lurk in the shadows and pull the puppet
strings to get things done
that allows them to have power the way
that you stop that influence
is to make sure that we all get out and
vote we have to stay on fire about the
issues we all have to take part
in our democracy.

#### Sarah Salgado
I’m actually not a politician
at all I’m a concerned citizen who can
see huge potential in Forney
however I also see some concerns that
need to be immediately addressed
my campaign is completely self-funded
that is a choice that I made for several
reasons I have watched over recent years as city
council campaigns here in Forney
have been funded and influenced by
outside special interest groups
I have chosen to accept no donations to
date from outside influencers
when I vote as a member of the city
council my vote will not be one that can
be bought my vote will not be one that can be
manipulated or influenced
when outside representatives who have a
financial stake in Forney
are able to influence our city council
members
that is not what is in the best interest
of our citizens if elected to the Forney
city council you can be assured that
when I vote it will be because it is
what is best for our city employees
our first responders and our citizens. 

#### Craig Chapman
My top three donors to this campaign are me
myself and I i am totally self-funded
throughout this campaign I don't
anticipate that changing
and it's important that this gets
brought up because unlike my opponent
I am the only independent voice in this
race I’m not a member of a team
and I don't have any running mates and
unlike this team that has expressed an
interest in being held accountable by
each other or other members of the
council
I only want to be held accountable by
you the people of Forney. 

### Question 4
**Choose a recent instance of a council action you either agreed or disagreed with what would you have done differently or the same?**

#### Jason Roberson
The city has approved a plan
for our roads but they have failed to
act upon it I believe that our roads with all the
growth that we have coming in
we have to fix our roads especially our
our older roads right around the
downtown area for far too long we've
written it off saying that this is just
a TxDOT issue but it's still Forney’s
problem so we have to we have to fix our roads
one thing that I recommend that we do
is I recommend that we form a coalition
with many of our
neighboring cities that all access
highway 80. I believe
that together we can have a stronger
voice and we can approach TxDOT
and we can get the answers that we need
so that we can prepare Forney
for the future.

#### Sarah Salgado
A recent council action
that has turned our city upside down
is a situation regarding our chief of
police and our city council
the the feeling in our city is actually
quite volatile it's been a circus
and it's honestly been embarrassing the
citizens of Forney deserve to have a
city council and a city manager that properly oversee
and govern our funds our city employees and the needs
of our citizens our town needs a city manager that leads
our city without ego
without arrogance and without
retaliation all of these things have
been happening at city hall
and this needs to change I have spent
time in recent months
meeting with current and former city
employees these are not disgruntled
employees
these are people who are educated who
have positive views of our city
who but who have ultimately decided to
leave our city due to the work
environment at city hall
this toxic work environment is bleeding
down to our citizens
our citizens have lost trust in our city
manager and our city council
I have disagreed with the recent action
of our city council
to keep mr carson as our city manager if
I was on the city council I would have
voted differently than our four members that voted to keep
them. 

#### Craig Chapman
Being a frontline healthcare worker
on this pandemic I strongly disagreed
with the council's direction
on the fourth of july event
holding it my concern was for the safety
of the city and 40 employees
at the time the virus was still
spreading we needed a mask mandate
my fear was just was just the safety of
the citizens and it's it's crazy this pandemic I’ve seen
it firsthand I’ve lost I’ve lost patients these are patients
who are grandparents their parents
one of my best friends in college lost
his dad so it really hits home that's a decision I
thought they should have reversed if I was in
that position we probably either would
have canceled the event or at least make
it mandatory for a city of Forney employees to wear
masks their safety should be top priority. 

### Question 5
**How does Forney best plan for the future? What specifically would you do to help?**

#### Jason Roberson
Right now we have a lot of silos that
are impeding our growth that are impeding
our ability to move forward
as a city I hope that we can break down
those silos and at least start meeting
right now the the school district that's
one of our greatest assets here in
florida we are growing so fast and our
school district is one of the top five
fastest growing school districts in the
state we need to be having regular meetings
but right now the Forney city council and the Forney
school board they do not meet regularly and they
haven't met regularly in at least five years just doesn't make
sense we have to break down those silos and we
have to work with our school district
so that we can figure out what do they
need to be able to continue to do the great job that
they're doing we also need to take a
good look at our roads
our roads need to be prepared for the
future we need to take a good look at
our budget right now our city budget we are
bringing in about
23 million dollars in revenue annually
but our budget is 19 to 20 million so
we're getting closer and closer
and closer to the edge that's not going
to be sustainable long-term
we have to be able to have a budget that
not only takes care of our core needs
right now
but also is forward-thinking enough to
plan for the future
thank you. 

#### Sarah Salgado
Our city is growing at a rapid
pace. To manage and control that rapid pace we
need to have firm plans set in place
the comprehensive plan for our roads was
last updated in 2016.
I would encourage every voting citizen
to look at the thoroughfare plan and the
comprehensive plan to see
what our city has accomplished I believe
that both of these plans need a thorough
update so that we can meet
the needs for our infrastructure
particularly our roads
our city also needs to quickly develop a
housing plan
our city currently has no plan for how
many rooftops our city will allow within
our city limits
at varying price points because of this
we are allowing developers to come in
and tell our city
how we will be developing our city
instead of the other way around
if our council had a set plan for what
our housing development in the future of
Forney will look like
we could tell developers if their plan
fit in with our vision
this needs to be addressed we also need
to work more closely with our first
responders in our schools
to develop a future plan for Forney we
need to have a school system that is not
overburdened by poor housing development
decisions we also need to thoroughly investigate
the funds that are being given to our
first responder groups
are they being supported financially are
they being supported by the actions of
our city council
when we first moved to Forney we looked
at two things we looked at the school
ratings and we looked at the crime
statistics
this is what other people look out to so
we need to protect especially our
relationship with our school district
and our first responder groups.

#### Craig Chapman
I think the best thing Forney can do is realize
that we are not only living in the best county
in Texas it's the fastest growing people want to
come here people are fleeing the big cities for
places like ours this is where a lot of people want to
call home it's not just
young families but young couples who
want to start families young
professionals older families I mean this this is the
best place to be right now in the state
of Texas
the best thing we can do as a city is
embrace that
people love Forney I think one plan we
have to do is with our infrastructure we
have to make sure that
our sidewalks are complete that goes
along with the 2016 park plan
that if I’m elected to the city council
we'll continue moving towards
we have to make sure that our
relationship with txdot
is still solid which it is today
we need to make sure that our schools
are properly funded so when new
developments come in or new projects
come in
that they benefit the citizens of Forney
in the future
not just the people who live here now
but the people who are going to call
Forney home
decades from now.
